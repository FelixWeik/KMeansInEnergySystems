\begin{abstract}
Climate change is a pressing issue that has visible impacts.
In the energy sector too, climate change can already be observed, for example, the electrical infrastructure collapse due to the Californian wildfires in 2020 or the Ahrtal flood in 2021.
The increasing climate awareness prompts people to seek ways to optimize their energy usage and reduce their carbon footprint.
This work focuses on utilizing the k-means clustering algorithm to understand energy load patterns and thus improve the design of energy-saving incentives.
Known for its simplicity and efficiency in handling big datasets, k-means is one of the most popular and widely used clustering algorithms.
This work reviews its applications to answer the given questions.
The reviewed papers demonstrate k-means' applications from different perspectives, such as identifying home systems of best practices or reviewing energy efficiency metrics of Chinese industry sectors.
The results show that k-means works well in finding trends and patterns while handling large datasets efficiently.
This generates knowledge from the data, which can be used as input for higher-level models or decision-making processes.
Also, k-means' weaknesses in this area of usage are analyzed, namely the need for a priori knowledge for the number of clusters $k$ or the missing ability to spot single outliers in the data.
The algorithm is efficient in its computational complexity, however, multiple executions are needed to evade the risk of local optima.
This contributes to the understanding of energy load patterns and thus improves the design of energy-saving incentives.
